# Milestone Project 1 - InMadrid.com / Housing for Young Professionals & Students #

Website with Welcome page, Search Appartment and Rent out Appartment page including dropdown with Home Staging services page for landlord.

## User Centric Front-End Development Project: ##
In this project, I have create a 6 pages website for a Real Estate/Housing project in English and Spanish. This is a basic website for a future 
Housing project. It will include new funcionalities once we study JavaScript and other advanced languages to include data base, filter to the seacrh option, maps, etc. 
We are using fake pictures and fake contact details, it will show real information in future. 


## UX Process Desing: ##
This website is aimed to search housing options in Madrid for young professionals and students.
It is easily navigated with an easily understandable collapsible navigation bar. Including a Sing Up/Log In plus English or 
Spanish site buttons.

All infomation is displayed clear and easy to see and search options. 
2 Different parts are created, 1 for tenants and 1 for landlords who desire to rent out 
a house in Madrid.

Title tab including icon/logo InMadrid. Favicom created using pgn. to Favicon converter tool.


## Features: ##
All pages on this site include the "Header with Navigtion" and "Footer". The Header consists of the 
collapsible navigation bar with a dropdown menu for Lanlords to learn about How to rent out and Homestaging services. 
The Footer has links to Contact info. with my own e-mail adress (rmf1312@hotmail.com, info@inmadrid.com doesn't exist yet) and Social Media links to the main pages of 
the sites (not social real links created yet for our brand InMadrid.) : Facebook, Pinterest, Instagram.

The colors used in this project were:

"#434738" (Dark grey. Text Color)
"#B5D43C" (Olive Green. Text color, Buttons)
"#D9EF81" (Light Olive Green. Background, Button)
"#F7F7F7" (Light Grey. Nav Text, Background )
"#E6E3E3" (Lighter Grey. Navbar Hover Effect)

I have imported the fonts from Google Fonts: "'Nunito', sans-serif;"."

added my own CSS to style of the website, using also Googlefonts to add new fonts and Font Awesome 5 for icons.
