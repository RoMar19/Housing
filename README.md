# Milestone Project 1 - InMadrid.com / Housing for Young Professionals & Students #

Housing Website with Welcome page, Search Appartment for tenants and Rent  Appartment out page including dropdown with Home Staging services page for owners/landlords.

## User Centric Front-End Development Project: ##
In this project, I have create a 6 pages website for a Housing project in English and Spanish.
This is a basic website for a future Housing project using Java Script and other advanced languages to include new funcionalities as real listing with data base, filters 
to the seacrh option, maps, etc. 
We are using fake pictures and fake contact details, it will show real information in future. 


## UX Process Desing: ##
This website is aimed to search housing options in Madrid for young professionals and students.
It is easily navigated with an easily understandable collapsible navigation bar. Including a Sing Up/Login plus English or 
Spanish language site buttons.

All infomation is displayed clear and easy to see and search options. 
2 Different parts are created, 1 for tenants and 1 for owners/landlords who desire to rent out 
a house in Madrid with Contact us option to expliain how we work.



## Features: ##
All pages on this site include the "Header with Navigtion" and "Footer". The Header consists of the 
collapsible navigation bar with a dropdown menu for Lanlords to learn about How to rent out and Home Staging services. 
The Footer has links to Contact info. with my own e-mail adress (rmf1312@hotmail.com, info@inmadrid.com doesn't exist yet) and Social Media links to the main pages of 
the sites (not social real links created yet for our brand InMadrid.) : Facebook, Pinterest, Instagram.
